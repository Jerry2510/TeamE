        <p> Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, also known as Mahatma Gandhi, was the leader of the Indian independence movement against British rule. 
            He employed nonviolent civil disobedience as a means to achieve his goals. Gandhi is internationally honored for his philosophy of nonviolence and his leadership of the Indian independence movement.

Gandhi was educated in Porbandar and Rajkot. In 1887, he went to England to study law. After graduating from law school in 1891, Gandhi returned to India and began practicing law in Bombay. In 1893, he was hired to represent an Indian firm in a court case in South Africa. While in South Africa, Gandhi became involved in the struggle of Indian immigrants against racial discrimination. He led a number of successful protests against discrimination, and he developed his philosophy of nonviolent civil disobedience.</p>
